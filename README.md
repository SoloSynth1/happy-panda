# Overview
HappyPanda: E-Hentai/ExHentai image grabber

This is a Chrome extension that downloads the image shown on the current E-Hentai/ExHentai page.

I'm not proficient in JavaScript so the codes might look a bit awkward to others, but it works perfectly.
Adding functionalities in near future.

# How to use
1. Load this extension into your Chrome.
2. Navigate e-hentai/exhentai, open an image page. 
3. Click on the panda icon on the extension tab.
4. It will automatically download the highest quality image available.
5. Rinse and repeat! It should automatically go to the next page.
